# FridaysAtFour-07-April-2023-Notes

- This week we had the first big performance change.
- They changed how bonuses are calculated behind the scenes.
- It sort of changed the order of content coming out
- Sneak peek of the new forums (no ETA, weeks rather than months), existing DDO forums will be in a read-only state when the new forums are launched.

  1. you will be chooseing a new forum name and prominant people of the community will not be having their name sniped (streamers and youtubers)
  2. You will log into the forums with the same user and pass that you use to log into the game, each forum account will be tied to a game account
  3. in many ways the new forums will be oriented the same as the old forums with some new features
  4. Images provided are a propped test, this is all a work in progress.
